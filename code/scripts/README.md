# Scripts Folder

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating the use of various libraries and frameworks for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Contents

1. [matplotlib_script.py](code/scripts/matplotlib_script.py)
   - A script showcasing how to create and customize plots using Matplotlib for data visualization.
   - [Matplotlib Tips and Tricks](docs/getting_started/matplotlib_basics.md#matplotlib_tips) for enhancing plotting capabilities and efficiency.

2. [pytorch_script.py](code/scripts/pytorch_script.py)
   - A script demonstrating how to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch for image classification.
   - [PyTorch Tips and Tricks](docs/advanced_topics/pytorch_advanced.md#pytorch_tips) for optimizing model training, utilizing GPU resources, and improving performance.

## Script Descriptions

### 1. `matplotlib_script.py`

This script illustrates basic and advanced techniques for creating plots using Matplotlib, a popular plotting library in Python. It includes:

- Customizing plot appearance with different styles, markers, and colors.
- Adding titles, labels, legends, and gridlines to enhance plot clarity.
- Saving plots as image files (e.g., PNG) for sharing and documentation.

### 2. `pytorch_script.py`

This script demonstrates the construction and training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. Key features include:

- Loading and preprocessing datasets using torchvision and transforms.
- Defining a CNN architecture with convolutional and fully connected layers.
- Optimizing model parameters with backpropagation and the Adam optimizer.
- Evaluating model performance on a test dataset and computing accuracy.

## Usage

To run these scripts locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed):
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Navigate to the `scripts` folder:
   ```
   cd code/scripts
   ```

4. Execute the desired script using Python:
   ```
   python matplotlib_script.py
   python pytorch_script.py
   ```

Ensure that you have Python and necessary libraries (Matplotlib, PyTorch, torchvision) installed in your environment before running the scripts.
