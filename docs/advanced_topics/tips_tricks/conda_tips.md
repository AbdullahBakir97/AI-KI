conda activate myenv

# Deactivate the environment
conda deactivate
```

## Package Management

### Updating Packages

Keep packages up to date in Conda environments:

```bash
# Update all packages
conda update --all
```

### Dependency Management

Resolve package dependencies and conflicts:

# Create a channel
conda index <path-to-channel>
```
