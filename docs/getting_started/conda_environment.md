## Creating Conda Environments

### Create a New Environment

Use the `conda create` command to create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.x
```

### Create Environment from YAML File

Create an environment from a YAML file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

---

## Activating and Deactivating Environments

### Activate an Environment

Activate an existing environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### Deactivate the Environment

Deactivate the current environment:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

---

## Managing Packages in Environments

### Install Packages

Install packages in the active environment:

```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Update Packages

Update packages in the active environment:

```bash
conda update numpy
```

---

## Sharing Environments

### Export Environment

Export environment details to a YAML file:

```bash
conda env export > environment.yaml
```

### Create Environment from File

Create an environment from a YAML file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```
