## Usage

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AbdullahBakir97/AI-KI.git
   cd AI-KI
   ```

2. Follow the installation guides in the `docs/installation/` folder to set up Anaconda, Jupyter, NumPy, PyTorch, and Matplotlib.

3. Explore the `docs/getting_started/` folder for introductory guides and basics of using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook/Lab, NumPy, PyTorch, and Matplotlib.

4. Dive into advanced topics in the `docs/advanced_topics/` folder for in-depth insights and advanced techniques.

5. Check out the Jupyter Notebooks (`code/notebooks/`) and scripts (`code/scripts/`) for practical implementations and examples.

## Tips & Tricks

- Utilize Jupyter's magic commands (`%matplotlib inline`, `%%timeit`, etc.) for enhanced productivity and performance monitoring.
  
- Incorporate interactive widgets (`ipywidgets`) in Jupyter for dynamic data exploration and visualization.
  
- Leverage Markdown formatting in Jupyter cells for documentation, including equations (`$E = mc^2$`), images (`![Image](image.png)`), and hyperlinks (`[Link](https://example.com)`).

- Use Git for version control. Save snapshots of your work and track changes over time.
  
- Share notebooks via GitHub or JupyterHub for collaborative work. Use nbviewer for publicly sharing notebooks online.
