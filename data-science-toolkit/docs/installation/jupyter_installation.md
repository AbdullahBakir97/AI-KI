## Installing Jupyter with Anaconda

Anaconda includes Jupyter Notebook by default, making it easy to get started.

### Windows, macOS, Linux

1. **Install Anaconda**:
   - Follow the instructions in [Anaconda Installation Guide](anaconda_installation.md) to install Anaconda.

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open Anaconda Navigator or Anaconda Prompt.
   - Click on the Jupyter Notebook icon in Anaconda Navigator, or run the following command in Anaconda Prompt:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

## Installing Jupyter with pip

If you prefer installing Jupyter using pip in an existing Python environment:

### Windows, macOS, Linux

1. **Install Jupyter with pip**:
   - Make sure pip is installed:
     ```bash
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
     ```
   - Install Jupyter:
     ```bash
     pip install jupyter
     ```

## Launching Jupyter Notebook

Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can start it from the command line:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser.

## Using JupyterLab

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

### Launching JupyterLab

1. **Install JupyterLab** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

2. **Launch JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

### JupyterLab Extensions

JupyterLab supports extensions for additional functionality. Install extensions using `jupyter labextension install`.

## Jupyter Configuration

Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab configurations allow customization of settings and extensions.

### Configuring Jupyter

- Generate a Jupyter configuration file:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook --generate-config
  ```

- Edit the configuration file (`~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py`) to customize settings.

## Additional Tips & Tricks

- Use keyboard shortcuts (`Esc` then `H` in Jupyter Notebook) for quick navigation.
- Share Jupyter notebooks using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
- Utilize magic commands (`%` for line magic, `%%` for cell magic) to enhance productivity.

## Conclusion

Installing Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab provides a flexible and interactive environment for data science and computational workflows. Mastering these tools will enhance your productivity and collaboration capabilities.
