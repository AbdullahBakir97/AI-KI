# PyTorch Basics

## Introduction

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python that provides tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration and deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system. This guide covers the basics of PyTorch, its key features, and how to get started with building and training neural networks.

## Installing PyTorch

To install PyTorch, refer to the [PyTorch Installation Guide](../installation/pytorch_installation.md).

---

## Tensors in PyTorch

### Creating Tensors

Create tensors in PyTorch for numerical computations:

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(x)
```

### Tensor Operations

Perform basic operations on tensors:

```python
y = torch.tensor([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])
z = x + y
print(z)
```

---

## Autograd and Automatic Differentiation

### Automatic Differentiation

Utilize PyTorch's autograd to automatically compute gradients:

```python
x = torch.tensor([1.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x**2
y.backward()
print(x.grad)
```

---

## Building Neural Networks

### Define a Neural Network

Build a simple neural network using PyTorch's `torch.nn` module:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class NeuralNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NeuralNet, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(1, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

model = NeuralNet()
print(model)
```

---

## Training a Model

### Define a Loss Function and Optimizer

Train a neural network model using PyTorch's built-in functions:

```python
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

---

## Saving and Loading Models

### Save and Load Models

Save and load trained models for inference or further training:

```python
# Save model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')

# Load model
model = NeuralNet()
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
```
