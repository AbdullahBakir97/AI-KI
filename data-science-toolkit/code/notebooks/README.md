# Notebooks

Welcome to the Notebooks section of our project repository! This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing various data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning tasks using Python libraries.

## Contents

1. [**notebooks1.ipynb**](code/notebooks/example_notebooks1.ipynb): This notebook covers fundamental data analysis techniques including data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and basic machine learning model training and evaluation.

2. [**notebooks2.ipynb**](code/notebooks/example_notebooks2.ipynb): This notebook dives into advanced topics such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning with TensorFlow/Keras. It includes implementations of ARIMA models, sentiment analysis, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Usage

To run the notebooks locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
   ```

2. Install the required libraries (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras nltk
   ```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the desired notebook (`notebooks1.ipynb` or `notebooks2.ipynb`) in the Jupyter interface and execute cells sequentially.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Magic Commands**: Utilize Jupyter's magic commands (`%matplotlib inline`, `%%timeit`, etc.) to enhance productivity and performance monitoring.
  
- **Interactive Widgets**: Incorporate interactive widgets (`ipywidgets`) for dynamic data exploration and visualization.
  
- **Markdown Formatting**: Leverage Markdown cells for documentation, including equations (`$E = mc^2$`), images (`![Image](image.png)`), and hyperlinks (`[Link](https://example.com)`).

- **Version Control**: Use notebook checkpoints and Git for version control. Save snapshots of your work and track changes over time.
  
- **Collaboration**: Share notebooks via GitHub or JupyterHub for collaborative work. Use nbviewer for publicly sharing notebooks online.
